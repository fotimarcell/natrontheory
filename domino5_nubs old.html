                Important note: since no one has built a life-sized, massive megalithic wall in modern times, any idea
                related to nubs remains theoretical. This concept, while logical and based on significant facts, is
                speculative and thus, not immune to being incorrect.<br><br>
                But still...

                    <p>What are megalithic nubs?</p>
                    There is a globally observable phenomenon in megalithic architecture: the nubs—those protruding
                    elements on huge stone blocks, like the ones in Ollantaytambo, Peru.
                    <br /><br>
                    Considering the monumental task it would have been to senselessly chisel off a full 2-inch thickness
                    from the stones just to make these protrusions, we can immediately deduce they were not crafted in
                    such a manner. After all, who would be foolish enough to undertake such a feat?

                    Another interesting question besides "how were they made" is "what were they made for"?
                    A common
                    belief is that these were created to make it easier to lift the multi-ton stones.<br><br>
                    But if we look at this famous one located in Cusco, focusing on the large stone in the center, it
                    becomes clear that this explanation is ridiculous.<br><br>
                    This nub is too small, there's only one, and it's in an impractical corner.

                    What other characteristics should we pay attention to? So far, in every example we've examined, the
                    nubs were
                    at the bottom of the rock.<br><br>
                    Let's look around the globe to see if the nubs are at the bottom in other locations as well.<br><br>
                    At first glance, it seems we are in luck because the nubs on the Pyramid of Menkaure, which is only
                    half a planet away, are also at the bottom.

                    Before we look at a fine example where the nubs are not at the bottom of the stone, let's introduce
                    a new concept related to nubs. We will refer to those at the bottom of the stones as technical
                    nubs.<br><br>
                    Additionally, there are non-technical nubs that serve specific roles, possibly even encoding
                    messages. I'm not dismissing this possibility. We will refer to these as functional nubs.
                    <br><br>
                    Technical nubs are a byproduct of stone-making technology and are essential for the integrity of the
                    stone, similar to the nubs found in a Roman amphitheater in Turkey.

                    Before you think we are selectively presenting certain types of nubs, let's see a good example where
                    the
                    nubs aren't on the bottom, yet we can still explain them later.<br><br>
                    These nubs are lined up on one side of the Acropolis in Greece, with none on
                    the lower side of the stone. What's going on here?<br><br>
                    Let's set these aside for now; we'll return to them later and continue our discussion.

                    Another good question is how ancient stone carvers achieved such precision that not even a razor
                    blade could be inserted between two stones.<br><br>
                    This level of precision was certainly not achieved by lifting, carving here and there, and trying to
                    put the 20-ton blocks back a dozen times. Such an approach would be madness.<br><br>
                    Instead, they cast the stones directly into the wall, right next to the previous one. The
                    heaviest item they would have needed to lift was merely a bucket.<br><br>
                    (Oh, and nubs can be on the other side of the wall, of course.)

                    absolutely necessary for certain stone walls but not for others? <br><br>
                    There was something that these ancient civilizations couldn't control during stone-making, even
                    though they obviously knew the recipe—as evidenced by the existing stones.<br><br>
                    There was something that consistently spoiled their efforts, unless...<br><br>

                    <p>The Water Problem</p>
                    Although they knew the recipe for making stone, they were baffled as to why the material became
                    soaking wet during mixing. Somehow, water was inexplicably entering the mix.<br><br>
                    They simply couldn't control the amount of water in
                    the mix. No matter how little water they added, many times
                    that amount would appeared later on in the material. <br><br>
                    Enough talking, let's see a concrete example!

                    It's important to note
                    that very little waterglass is added, and the mix starts out almost bone dry. However, as he begins
                    to
                    stir and knead, the material becomes increasingly moist, eventually turning completely

                    What happened here is that one of the components of the wood ash is a hydrate, containing water
                    molecules embedded within.
                    So the ash appears dry, feels dry - it's definitely dry, but...<br><br>
                    However, one of its components secretly contains bound water molecules. These water molecules are
                    held captive until the component itself transforms into another molecule. <br><br>
                    At that moment, the previously held water molecules are released. You can't control this process,
                    you
                    can't undo it.
                    And this is only the first hydrate in the mix...

                    In the 21st century we purchase waterglass by the gallon at the hardware store. It's a liquid.
                    Easy to handle, easy to control the amount of water, because that water is not hidden.<br><br>
                    But what our ancestors produced through the ecthing of stones was solid
                    waterglass powder.
                    It's dry, but it's a hydrate. Specifically, a pentahydrate, where every waterglass
                    molecule holds five (5!) water molecules captive.<br><br>
                    Look, how the dry waterglass suddenly turns into a liquid! It's not melting, it's releasing hidden
                    water!

                    (wood ash and waterglass)? Just one drop. A
                    single drop to start the reaction.<br><br>
                    You can start kneading a small stone with one single drop of water, and if you handle it like a
                    snowball,
                    by gradually increasing its size, it will release enough water on its own to grow huge without any
                    additional water. <br><br>
                    We tried it, and this method works. <br><br>

                    lift them up and place them into their spot in the wall.
                    That's a stupid idea.<br><br>
                    Our ancestors had to add a specific initial amount of
                    water to the stone mix and disperse it evenly; otherwise, the chemical process wouldn't
                    start.<br><br>
                    Every drop of water they initially added became excess water as the reaction began. And probably

                    That would solve all our problems at once.
                    We'll get there, but for that, humanity has had to
                    recognize the exact cause of the problem.<br><br>
                    The Incas, and other peoples around the world, clearly did
                    not realize this and therefore could do nothing more than leave a small hole on the mold for the
                    excess
                    water to escape.

                    The next strategy might have been to recognize that the dry waterglass was not actually dry.<br><br>
                    To eliminate this problem, it's sufficient to heat the waterglass powder until it transforms into a
                    liquid, as shown in the pot above. This method ensures that the liquid waterglass alone is enough to
                    initiate the chemical reaction; thus, there is no need to add extra water to the mix.<br><br>
                    However, this still leaves the
                    problem of the ash, though the amount of excess water is significantly reduced.

                    ash.<br><br>
                    Another advantage of this is that it also gets rid of the ugly gray color, assuming the replacement

                    <p>Different stone families</p>
                    First, let's consider the fact that the Acropolis is made of limestone, which belongs to a
                    completely different rock family than quartz-based granite, basalt, etc.<br><br>
                    Limestone is composed of the remnants of minuscule dead marine animals from billions of years ago,
                    and is unrelated to waterglass or wood ash. <br><br>
                    However, if we also find nubs here, could this suggest that limestone can also be
                    produced artificially?

                    <p>Artificial limestone</p>
                    Yes, limestone can indeed be produced artificially, and this was demonstrated by none other than
                    Joseph Davidovits, often referred to as the father of geopolymers. <br><br>
                    In 2002, he created several
                    20-ton limestone blocks as evidence that the pyramids could also have been made from cast
                    stones.<br><br>
                    He used - surprise! - natron and a soft limestone to cast those blocks.

                    <p>Another hydrate!</p>
                    Davidovits used natron the way Imhotep did, by dissolving it in water. However, had he attempted to
                    use it dry, adding water to the stone mixture afterwards, he would have been quite
                    surprised.<br><br>
                    The bone-dry natron, which can also be found in Wadi el Natron, is not merely a hydrate, but a
                    decahydrate! Deca = 10. <br><br>
                    It releases ten molecules of water during a chemical reaction. That's a heck of a lot
                    of water! Could this have caused the great flood? 🤭

                    <p>Nubs in the middle?</p>
                    If an architect of a certain era, specifically an ancient Greek now, wanted to create stones using
                    "dry" natron technology, then they definitely needed the nubs. Without draining the excess water,
                    their stones would never have set. However, these nubs are not at the bottom!<br><br>
                    Not only that, but the size of the blocks appear identical!<br><br>
                    What's going on here?

                    <p>Cast in a mold vs. cast in place</p>
                    While the stones of the Inca walls were cast in place directly into the
                    wall and were never moved again, the Greeks cast these stones into a mold, which explains their
                    uniformity. (They were also smaller because they needed to be lifted afterwards.) <br><br>
                    The nubs were turned outward when the stones were assembled into the wall at the Acropolis, to
                    prevent the stones from wobbling against each other.<br><br>
                    Indeed, the two techniques could also be combined. Let's take a look at a compelling example!

                    It would be hard to imagine a more beautiful ending. Take a look at this limestone gate and notice
                    the nubs on it. <br><br>
                    What's particularly interesting here is that while the two columns were cast
                    standing up, possibly on site since the nubs are on the bottom of the column, the lintel was cast
                    separately in a
                    mold that included two drainage holes at each end. <br><br>
                    After that, they rotated the finished lintel to ensure it wouldn't wobble and
                    placed it on top of the columns. The two stones below were not cast in this position either; they
                    were cast with the nubs facing downward.

                    While everything here is completely logical and based on facts and chemistry, it's not
                    impossible that it's entirely mistaken. <br><br>
