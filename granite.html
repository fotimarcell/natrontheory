                    alkali can harm it. Our ancestors had to use copper chisels and stone tools to carve granite.
                    <br /><br>
                    <b>WRONG!</b><br>
                    Many different chemicals can damage granite, and among them there is also an acid.

                    Yeah, for the sake of completeness, there is an acid that etches granite. But...<br><br>
                    Hydrofluoric acid is nearly impossible to store because it corrodes everything, including glass,
                    ceramics, and
                    metals. Moreover, it is highly toxic.
                    We don't believe our ancestors were handling this acid. They have used something else.

                    <p>Natron!</p>
                    However, there is another substance mentioned before, sodium carbonate, or natron in short
                    (Na2CO3), a white powder, which, when heated to 851 degrees Celsius, eats granite for breakfast.
                    <br><br>
                    And here, we could recap the list we've already seen of the various uses the Egyptians had for
                    natron. They knew this material very well, not like in our modern times.

                    <p>How is etching granite possible?</p>
                    The essence of the matter is that granite is a complex material, with 70-77% of it being SiO2, or
                    commonly known as quartz. The rest are tiny-tiny, colorful granite (feldspar) grains. Molten sodium
                    carbonate (natron) breaks down quartz, and so, granite as
                    well, liberating the tiny-tiny, colorful grains. <br><br>
                    This is a piece of red granite after a good bath in molten narton.

                    <p>What is molten natron?</p>
                    Molten natron is a liquid. At 851 degrees Celsius, it turns into a glowing, corrosive reddish liquid
                    from its fine white powder form.<br><br>
                    Reaching a temperature of 851 degrees Celsius is quite easy with the help of charcoal.<br><br>
                    (The natron doesn't etch the stone in this video, but only because the heat dissipates
                    immediately. Don't be impatient.)

                    <p>A grill chimney!</p>
                    As you've seen, all you need is a grill chimney and some charcoal to be able to etch granite at
                    home.<br><br>
                    Additionally, you'll need some kind of container to put your stone and natron in. This could be an
                    empty tin can.<br><br>
                    This setup retains the necessary heat for the natron to stay molten and do its work. And no, this is
                    not how ancient Egyptians did this.

                    <p>Volcanic rock types</p>
                    Molten natron also etches all other volcanic rocks with quartz as their binding material.<br><br>
                    Without claiming to be exhaustive, it also etches
                    these rocks: sandstone, volcanic tuff, diorite, quartzite, basalt.
                    <br><br>
                    Which means if you can work on granite with molten natron, you can also work on these stone types as
                    well.
