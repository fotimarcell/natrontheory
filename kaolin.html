                    We have a great example showing how modern man is capable of transporting ancient, multi-ton
                    sandstone
                    colossi carved from a single stone from point A to B. This occurred during the construction of the
                    Aswan Dam, where several ancient Egyptian temples had to be saved from flooding. In 1963,
                    professionals transported two stone temples at Abu Simbel.<br><br>
                    They also had to move these four massive statues carved from a single rock located at the entrance
                    of the temple.

                    <p>The technology behind</p>
                    The technology used was as follows: they lifted the temple and the statues with
                    heavy machinery and helicopters... Oh wait, no. <br><br>
                    They actually cut them into 807 pieces. Eight hundred and seven.<br><br>Modern man
                    doesn't have any other technology to move these hundred-ton statues other than by cutting them up
                    and
                    moving them piece by piece. This is exactly what happened at Abu Simbel.

                    <p>How ancient Egyptians did it?</p>
                    Well, there are quite a few huge, single-piece granite statues and blocks, some weighing several
                    hundred tons,
                    scattered throughout Egypt, which have been shown to come from granite sourced 800 km away. How is
                    that possible? <br><br> Well, there is a wall painting where we see the Egyptians dragging a huge
                    statue on a
                    wooden sledge across the sand. One person is pouring water in front of the sledge onto the sand to
                    facilitate sliding. <br><br>

                    <p>Put the stone on a ship!</p>
                    It's certain that the method above works for small distances. You could drag it all the way to a
                    ship, and you can take the stone as far as you want by boat.<br><br>
                    However, the
                    largest known ancient Egyptian cargo ship, which was recontructed by British Museum's
                    archaeologists,
                    has only 17 tons of capacity. With this, they
                    couldn't even transport 20-ton stones. <br><br>
                    Could they have had 5-10 times larger ships? Yes, of course. Just because we didn't find them
                    doesn't prove they couldn't have existed. So far so good.

                    <p>The Serapeum</p>
                    In Saqqara, there's a place called the Serapeum, where underground caverns house giant stone
                    sarcophagi, each weighing 40 tons, made from noble stones like granite, basalt, and diorite.
                    <br><br>
                    This is fascinating because we just saw how many
                    people and how much space is needed to move a 20-ton statue. Well, that was not possible here. These
                    sarcophagi were not brought in this way.<br><br>
                    If we discard both the UFO and the Harry Potter theories, we don't have many choices left to explain
                    this...

                    However, there's an additional possibility for how all this could have been done. If the Egyptians
                    knew about artificial stones, they could have brought the raw materials easily into the tunnel in
                    buckets
                    and cast the sarcophagi on site. <br><br> So, either they didn't move these 40-ton boxes around at
                    all, or
                    they did it with buckets, depending on your perspective. <br><br>
                    That is, if they even knew the artificial stone technology.

                    To evaluate this, let's review what modern geopolymers, or artificial stones, are made of.

            <div>Every ancient civilization with access to natron knew how to make waterglass. We see evidence of this
                everywhere (scoopmarks). And undoubtedly, they had access to wood ash. The question is whether they
                tried to mix the
                two. If they did, they could have created artificial stone.
                Let's recap what we know so far:

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Molten natron etches quartz, consequently, granite</li>
                <li>Etching granite produces waterglass</li>
                <li>Waterglass is the main component of geopolymers</li>
            </ul>
