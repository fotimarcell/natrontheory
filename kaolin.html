                    We have a great example showing how modern man is capable of transporting ancient, multi-ton granite
                    colossi carved from a single stone from point A to B. This occurred during the construction of the
                    Aswan Dam, where several ancient Egyptian temples had to be saved from flooding. In 1963,
                    professionals transported two stone temples at Abu Simbel.<br><br>
                    They also had to move these four massive granite statues located at the entrance of the temple.

                    <p>The technology behind</p>
                    The technology used was as follows: they lifted the temple and the statues with
                    heavy machinery and helicopters... Oh wait, no. <br><br>
                    They actually cut them into 807 pieces. Modern man
                    doesn't have any other technology to move these hundred-ton statues other than by cutting them up
                    and
                    moving them piece by piece. This is exactly what happened at Abu Simbel.

                    <p>How ancient Egyptians did it?</p>
                    Well, there are countless huge, single-piece granite statues and blocks, some weighing several hundred tons,
                    scattered throughout Egypt, which have been shown to come from granite sourced 800 km away. How is
                    that possible? <br><br> Well, there is a wall painting where we see the Egyptians dragging a huge
                    statue on a
                    wooden sledge across the sand. One person is pouring water in front of the sledge onto the sand to
                    facilitate sliding. <br><br>

                    It's certain that the method above works for small distances. You could drag it all the way to a ship.<br><br>
                    However, it is problematic that the 
                    largest known ancient Egyptian cargo ship, which was recontructed by British Museum's archaeologists,
                    has only 17 tons of capacity. With this, they
                    couldn't even transport 20-ton stones. <br><br>
                        Could they have had larger ships? Yes, of course. Let's say we
                     haven't found them. However, this theory does not hinge on that.

                    Returning to the original mural, we can see a white pile of something accumulating in the
                    background. That something is contaminated with black specks. <br><br>
                    Of course, it's contaminated because
                    it's mixed with the remaining charcoal. Then this white substance is carried around in bags, poured
                    out, and someone molds a wall out of it. <br><br>All this is depicted in a singe mural (of smelting
                    metal)!

            <div>Every ancient civilization with access to natron knew how to make waterglass. We see evidence of this
                everywhere (scoopmarks). And undoubtedly, they had access to wood ash. The question is whether they
                tried to mix the
                two. If they did, they could have created artificial stone.
                Let's recap what we know so far:

            <ul>
                <li>Molten natron etches quartz, consequently, granite</li>
                <li>Etching granite produces waterglass</li>
                <li>Waterglass is the main component of geopolymers</li>
