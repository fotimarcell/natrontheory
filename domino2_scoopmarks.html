                    <p>The Unfinished Obelisk in Assuan, Egypt</p>
                    The unfinished obelisk is a massive, 40 meters long, 1100-ton granite block, whose carving was
                    inexplicably halted by our ancestors. This has provided a great opportunity for us to examine how
                    they worked. <br><br>
                    It's certain that they didn't do it the way a modern person would. There are all sorts of strange
                    processing marks around the obelisk.<br><br>
                    And the famous diorite "pounding stones", of course.

                    <p>The Scoop Marks Mystery</p>
                    Around the unfinished obelisk, on the obelisk itself, and next to it in the trench, you can find
                    distinctive depressions known as scoop marks. <br><br>
                    According to the official explanation, these were
                    created by diligent individuals using diorite pounding stones to carve them deeper and deeper.

                    <p>What's wrong with this explanation?</p>
                    This explanation has several issues. Not only is it incredibly difficult work, but in some places,
                    like under the obelisk, it's downright impossible. <br><br>
                    Secondly, it's entirely illogical to create
                    nearly perfectly square depressions when one could make significant progress by simply knocking off
                    the ridges. In fact, crushing the ridges would be "the" solution for this hard carving problem.

                    <p>The Natron Theory</p>
                    The natron theory states that our ancestors weren't foolish. <br><br> They didn't start carving
                    granite with
                    pounding stones if they knew that using molten natron made the work much easier. Once they had
                    worked
                    the surface with natron, carving became child's play.<br><br>
                    They could definitely have used their pounding stones after etching the surface. In fact, that would
                    have been a completely logical step, because they had to crush and remove the residue before a
                    second round of etching.<br><br>

                    <p>What does the theory predict?</p>
                    According to the theory, these depressions served the purpose of melting natron on the surface of
                    the granite since molten natron is a liquid, and the edges were necessary to prevent it from
                    spreading all over the area.<br><br>
                    But how to heat the granite surface?<br><br>
                    The challenge in heating the granite surface is that the heat dissipates. How did the Egyptians
                    solve this problem?

                    There's a certain wall painting in the Metropolitan Museum, known as the Tomb of Rekhmire, that
                    depicts metal smelting. <br><br>
                    But if you spend some time
                    analysing the picture, you realize this is the most idiotic way of doing any metal work.<br><br>
                    Let's see what these guys are actually doing.

                    <p>Melting iron on the floor?</p>
                    Let's start with the upper left part. Here, two people are clearly sharpening fire with some tool -
                    on the floor. <br><br>
                    The problem with this is that the floor, like any large stone surface, almost sucks
                    the heat out from underneath the tool. Not only is there a problem with what these good people will
                    do if the metal accidentally melts on the floor, but also with the fact that they're deliberately
                    making the work process more difficult by doing it on a challenging surface, reducing their chances
                    of success.<br><br>
                    Not to mention that what lurks beneath the embers doesn't even look like metal or ore.

                    <p>Foot bellows</p>
                    The tool at their feet is fairly easy to identify - it's a bellows, equipped with strings. The
                    strings are used because, prior to the discovery of iron there were no
                    springs. So, instead of springs, strings are used to reset the bellows to their original position
                    after being stepped on.<br><br>
                    In the pile, since the men are heating the floor, it's natron. They are using
                    molten natron to etch the granite floor.<br><br>
                    There's no evidence for this because there's no description accompanying the wall
                    painting. If we say it's just a story, it's a much higher quality story anyway, than the official
                    version
                    about metal smelting.

                    If this story alone isn't convincing enough, let's take a different perspective. The natron theory
                    suggests that at the site of the unfinished obelisk, and in various places around the world where
                    scoop marks are found (Stonehenge, Peru, Sardinia, etc.), the primary goal wasn't actually stone
                    carving. <br><br>After all, etching doesn't allow for precise cutting surfaces. Carving was just a
                    secondary
                    aspect.

            <div>The real activity in all these locations was the production of waterglass itself. And the end product
                was not the obelisk, but the waterglass. Let's recap what we know so far:
