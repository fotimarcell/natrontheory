                    <p>Petra, Jordan</p>
                    The huge ancient stone carvings have always amazed modern people. How did they do it? With copper
                    chisels? That's impressive! A superhuman feat! But what if our ancestors weren't that crazy
                    and
                    instead chose an easier method?<br><br>
                    Let's assume they were aware of the stone-etching function of molten natron.
                    However, for "carvings" of such magnitude, they would have almost needed an unlimited supply of
                    natron.<br><br>Let's see, how far is the nearest
                    unlimited natron deposit from Petra!

                    Approximately 20 kilometers east of Petra lies a vast white expanse in the desert, spanning several
                    kilometers in diameter. What could this be? <br><br>
                    It seems improbable that it's snow since this is not a
                    high mountain region but one of the lowest areas on Earth.
                    Limestone? No. Limestone typically forms mountains, not a spread scattered across the desert's
                    surface. <br><br>That leaves us with salt. But what kind of salt?

                    <p>Salts are different</p>
                    There are various types of salts, with table salt (NaCl) being just one of them. Their common
                    characteristics include the ability to dissolve in water and precipitate when the water
                    evaporates.<br><br>
                    Besides table salt (NaCl), there's Epsom salt (MgSO4), road salt (MgCl2), and of course washing soda
                    or natron (Na2CO3), just to name a few.<br><br>
                    How do we produce them? (And why is it important?)

                    For millennia, humanity has been producing the different kind of salts it needs through salt
                    evaporation ponds. The principle here is that while the water evaporates and the pond slowly dries
                    up, the salt remains at the bottom of the pond and crystallizes.<br><br> Why is this important to
                    us?
                    Because exactly the same thing happens in nature, with just a tiny twist. Those salt evaporation
                    ponds aren't different colors by chance, but because...

                    <p>Precipitation order</p>
                    Salts don't all precipitate at the same time. Some salts remain in the diminishing water
                    much longer, while others precipitate in a rush. Salts have a precipitation order, with natron
                    leading the way.<br><br>
                    As a salty lake dries up and gradually recedes, it deposits the
                    salts it contains onto its shores in the sequence of precipitation of salts. There will be a band of
                    natron,followed by a band of such salts, then another type of salt, and finally, table salt
                    remains at the very end. Here is a typical precipitation order:
                    <ol style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>Natron (Sodium carbonate)</li>

                        <li>Magnesium sulfate</li>
                        <li>Potassium chloride</li>

                    Officially, of course, every site of unknown purpose is considered a burial site, and this one was
                    also carved out with sticks, obviously.

                    <p>Derinkuyu, Turkey</p>
                    In Turkey's Cappadocia, there are hundreds of underground cities carved into the rock, among which
                    Derinkuyu is the largest. With its 18 levels of depth and capacity to house 20,000 people, it
                    astonishes people today. <br><br>
                    It's true that these cities are carved into volcanic tuff, which is a
                    relatively "soft" stone, but even so, excavating such a large quantity with primitive tools must not
                    have been easy.<br><br>

                    ground.)<br><br>
                    BTW: why didn't they start carving the rock right at the lakeshore? Well, because there's usually no
                    volcanic rock at the shores of carbonated lakes. This is a limestone area. We need to move from
                    carbonate-rich soils to volcanic soils to

                    Those hundreds of underground

                    world, where either the water or the soil is salty. <br><br>
                    And it's important to note that it's enough for
                    the soil to be salty. The lake may be freshwater, but ground water will eventually pump up
                    sodium to
                    the
