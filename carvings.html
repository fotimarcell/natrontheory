                    <p>Petra, Jordan</p>
                    The huge ancient stone carvings have always amazed modern people. How did they do it? With copper
                    chisels? That's impressive! A superhuman feat! <br><br>But what if our ancestors weren't that crazy and
                    instead chose an easier method?<br><br>
                    What if they knew about the beneficial effects of molten natron? That would be a completely
                    different story. Let's see, how far is the nearest
                    unlimited natron deposit from Petra! Why not?

                    Approximately 20 kilometers east of Petra, in the desert, lies a vast white expanse spanning several
                    kilometers in diameter. What could this be? <br><br>
                    It seems improbable that it's snow since this is not a
                    high mountain region but one of the lowest areas on Earth.
                    Limestone? No. Limestone typically forms mountains, not a spread scattered across the desert's
                    surface. <br><br>That leaves us with salt. But what kind of salt?

                    <p>Salt evaporation</p>
                    For millennia, humanity has been producing the salt it needs through salt
                    evaporation ponds. The principle here is that while the water evaporates and the pond slowly dries
                    up, the salt remains at the bottom of the pond and crystallizes.<br><br> Why is this important to
                    us?
                    Because exactly the same thing happens in nature, with just a tiny twist. Those salt evaporation
                    ponds aren't different colors by chance, but because...

                    <p>Salts are different</p>
                    There are various types of salts, with table salt (NaCl) being just one of them. Their common
                    characteristics include the ability to dissolve in water and precipitate when the water
                    evaporates.<br><br>
                    However, they don't all precipitate at the same time. Some salts remain in the diminishing water
                    much longer,
                    while others precipitate in a rush. Salts have a precipitation order, with natron leading the way.
                    It always precipitates first.

                    <p>Precipitation order</p>
                    So, in nature, this is what occurs: as a salty lake dries up and gradually recedes, it deposits the
                    salts it contains onto its shores in the sequence of precipitation of salts. There will be a band of natron,
                    followed by a band of such salts, then another type of salt, and finally, table salt
                    remains at the very end. Here is a typical precipitation order:
                    <ol style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>Natron (Sodium carbonate)</li>
                        <li>Calcium sulfate</li>
                        <li>Magnesium sulfate</li>
                        <li>Potassium chloride</li>
                        <li>Sodium chloride (Table salt)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Salinization</p>
                    Now you can also figure out that if that spot there next to Petra is salt, then due to the
                    precipitation sequence, it's almost certainly natron. The same thing happens everywhere in the
                    world, where either the water or the soil is salty. <br><br>
                    And it's important to note that it's enough for
                    the soil to be salty. The lake may be freshwater, but ground water will eventually pump up sodium to the
                    surface. This latter process is called salinization, and it will be important later on.</div>

                    Returning to the original mural, we can see a white pile of something accumulating in the
                    background. That something is contaminated with black specks. <br><br>
                    Of course, it's contaminated because
                    it's mixed with the remaining charcoal. Then this white substance is carried around in bags, poured
                    out, and someone molds a wall out of it. <br><br>All this is depicted in a singe mural (of smelting
                    metal)!

            <div>Every ancient civilization with access to natron knew how to make waterglass. We see evidence of this
                everywhere (scoopmarks). And undoubtedly, they had access to wood ash. The question is whether they
                tried to mix the
                two. If they did, they could have created artificial stone.
                Let's recap what we know so far:
