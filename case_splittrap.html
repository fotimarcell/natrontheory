                    <p>The Mission</p>
                    In July 2025, armed with an XRF device, I traveled to Croatia to find out whether the
                    limestone blocks with nubs contain any foreign material — in other words, whether they’re natural or
                    man-made.
                    <br><br>
                    This device can determine which atoms are present in a thin surface layer of a material by analyzing
                    its X-ray backscatter. Since my artificial stone mixture contains potassium, that’s exactly what I
                    was looking for in the ancient stones.

                    <p>Ancient Croatia</p>
                    Croatia is full of megalithic relics, though most of them date back to the Roman era. There are
                    about a dozen abandoned towns like this one scattered along the ridgeline of the Dinaric Alps.
                    <br><br>
                    I visited five or six of these sites and eagerly pressed the XRF device’s lens against the walls,
                    but it didn’t detect any foreign material. Instead, I found something else: mortar between the
                    stones. And where there’s mortar, it’s not true polygonal masonry, so it’s no surprise there was no
                    potassium.

                    Searching for ancient sites led me to this limestone cave on the island of Brač. It’s called
                    Dragon’s Cave, and I wouldn’t recommend anyone attempt the hike without the official guide — the
                    scorching heat is one thing, but at the end of the trail the cave will be locked. The guide is the
                    one with the key.
                    <br><br>
                    Well, guess what — was there any potassium in this rock? You win! There wasn’t!

                    My final destination was the city of Split, where the beautifully restored 2nd-century Diocletian’s
                    Palace is the pride of the city.
                    <br><br>
                    And sure enough, we find limestone blocks with nubs all over the place —
                    sometimes in truly impossible locations, but that doesn’t deter a real researcher from scientific
                    investigation.
                    <br><br>
                    Out with the XRF device! No potassium. What the heck?

                    I had almost given up hope; I thought either the tool went wrong or I fundamentally
                    didn’t understand how the device worked. Back then I didn’t yet know that this instrument only
                    ‘sees’ a few micrometers deep — a depth from which potassium could easily have been washed away by
                    thousands of years of rain.
                    <br><br>
                    In hindsight, I now realize I should have looked for a stone in a
                    protected location from the start, say one that’s down in the basement of Diocletian’s Palace.

                    A stone exactly like this one here. I’ll show you the way if you ever feel like making a pilgrimage
                    to it. It’s not far: down in the basement, first room on the right, then straight across, and voilà.
                    <br><br>
                    Sure, it’s cracked all over the place—which is already weird for a lintel stone—but the important
                    thing now is: it DOES have potassium in it! Bingo!

                    <p>The potassium content</p>
                    Why do I think the potassium content means the stone is artificial? Because in marine sedimentary
                    limestone—like the kind the Dinaric Alps are made of—there is definitely no potassium.
                    <br><br>And the
                    reason is that potassium compounds are highly soluble in water and simply get flushed away with the
                    displaced seawater. The only natural limestones that can contain potassium are those where the water
                    gets trapped and evaporates, leaving it behind.
                    <br><br>
                    Pamukkale limestone, for instance, contains potassium. It is a fresh, freshwater limestone formed by
                    evaporation.

                    So, where’s the catch? Pay attention: these aren’t just ordinary cracks. They didn’t come from
                    weight—there’s nothing above, only a cavity—but from drying! That’s right: so called mud cracks!
                    <br><br>    
                    But how could that happen? Does natural limestone swell underwater and then crack when it dries?
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Absolutely not.</b> 
                    Natural limestone can’t do that. Only some soggy sludge behaves this way.

                    If the cracks couldn’t have appeared afterward, what if they were there from the start?
                    <br><br>
                    That would mean the ancient stonemasons were bloody idiots. 
                    <br><br>
                    But seriously—what are the chances that the
                    stonemasons back then would pick the absolute worst, all-shattered stone for a lintel? A LINTEL ffs!

                    <p>Catch-22</p>
                    So the cracks couldn’t have formed afterward, because natural limestone doesn’t do that—and
                    artificial limestone didn’t exist. 
                    <br><br>
                    And it couldn’t have formed beforehand either, because then they
                    wouldn’t have chosen it as a lintel.
                    <br><br>
                    We’ve reached a crossroads: this lintel is either made of
                    artificial limestone—or the people who installed it were complete idiots, putting a cracked stone in
                    as a lintel. Q. E. D.

                discovered it. That's just the icing on the cake. A lintel cracked all over with <b>mud
