Value:
<p>Any proof of ancient waterglass use?</p> Returning to the original mural, we can see a white pile of something accumulating in the background. That something is contaminated with black specks. <br><br> Of course, it's contaminated because it's mixed with the remaining charcoal. Then this white substance is carried around in bags, poured out, and someone molds a wall out of it. <br><br>All this is depicted in a singe mural (of smelting metal)!

<p>Where is the salt?</p>
                    About 30 kilometers east of Derinkuyu, there is a vast saltwater lake called Yay Gölü, where salt
                    extraction continues to this day with absolutely primitive methods. (Collecting it from the
                    ground.)<br><br>
                    BTW: why didn't they start carving the rock right at the lakeshore? Well, because there's usually no
                    volcanic rock at the shores of carbonated lakes. This is a limestone area. We need to move from
                    carbonate-rich soils to volcanic soils to
                    find quartz to work with.
