                since no one has built a life-sized, huge megalithic wall in modern times, any idea
                related to nubs can only be a concept. This is also just a concept, although it is so logical, and based
                on so important facts that it would be hard to imagine it being incorrect. <br><br>

                    <p>What are megalithic nubs?</p>
                    There is a
                    globally observable phenomenon in megalithic architecture, which is the nubs, those protruding
                    things on the huge stone blocks. Like these ones in Ollantaytambo, Peru.
                    <br /><br>

                    When we think about what a heroic task it must have been to senselessly chisel off a full 2-inch
                    thickness from the stones to make these things protrude, we immediately realize that they weren't
                    made this way. Because who would be foolish enough to do that...?

                    Another interesting question besides "how were they made" is "what were they made for"?
                    A common
                    belief is that these were created to make it easier to lift the multi-ton stones.<br><br>
                    But if we look at this famous one located in Cusco, focusing on the large stone in the center, we
                    can
                    easily realize that this explanation is ridiculous.<br><br>
                    This nub is too small, there's only one of it, and it's in an impossible corner.

                    What other characteristics should we pay attention to? So far, whichever we looked at, the nubs were
                    at the bottom of the rock.<br><br>
                    Let's look around the globe to see if the nubs are at the bottom in other locations as well.<br><br>
                    At first glance, it seems we are in luck because the nubs on the Pyramid of Menkaure, which is only
                    half a planet away, are also at the bottom.

                    Before we look at a fine example where the nubs are not at the bottom of the stone, let's introduce
                    a new concept related to nubs. Let's call those that are at the bottom of the stones technical
                    nubs.<br><br>
                    Because there are also non-technical nubs, that play a certain role, or even coding a message etc.
                    I'm not ruling out this possibility. Let's call those functional nubs.
                    <br><br>
                    Technical nubs are created as a result of stone-making technology and are essential for the health
                    of the stone. Like these nubs in a Roman amphitheater in Turkey.

                    Before you accuse us of filtering out various kinds of nubs we like, let's see a good example where
                    the
                    nubs aren't on the bottom, yet we can still explain them later.<br><br>
                    These nubs are lined up on one side of the Acropolis in Greece, and not a single one is found on
                    the lower side of the stone. What's going on here?<br><br>
                    Let's put these aside for now, we'll come back to them later, let's move on.

                    Another good question is how ancient stone carvers achieved such precision that a razor blade
                    couldn't be inserted between two stones. <br><br>
                    Certainly not by lifting, carving here and there a bit, and trying to put the
                    20-ton blocks back a dozen times. That would be madness. <br><br>
                    Rather, they cast the stones right into the wall,
                    directly next to the previous stone. The heaviest thing they have ever lifted was a bucket.<br><br>
                    (Oh, and nubs can be on the other side of the wall, of course.)

                    Okay, but let's say now, why was there a need for these nubs? What technical condition made them
                    absolutely necessary for certain stone walls (and not for others)? <br><br>
                    There was something that these ancient civilizations couldn't control during stone-making, even
                    though they obviously knew the recipe, as the stones are there. <br><br>
                    There was something that consistently spoiled their efforts. Unless...<br><br>

                    <p>The Water Problem</p>
                    Although they knew the recipe for making stone, they didn't know why the material became soaking wet
                    during
                    mixing. Somehow, water was getting into the mix out of nowhere.<br><br>
                    They simply couldn't control the amount of water in
                    the mix. No matter how little water they added to the mix, many times
                    that amount was appeared later on in the material. <br><br>
                    Enough talkink, let's see a concrete example!

                    It's important to note
                    that very little waterglass is added, and the mix starts out almost bone dry. But as he begins to
                    stir and knead, the material becomes increasingly moist, and by the end, it's completely
                    soggy.<br><br>

                    What happened here is that one of the components of the wood ash is a hydrate, containing water
                    molecules embedded.
                    So the ash looks dry, touches dry - it's definitely dry, but...<br><br>
                    But one of its components secretly contains bound water molecules. These water molecules
                    are held captive until the component itself transforms into another molecule. <br><br>
                    At that moment, the previously held water molecules become free again. You can't control it, you
                    can't undo it.
                    And this is only the first hydrate in the mix...

                    In the 21st century we buy waterglass by the gallon in the hardware store. It's a liquid.
                    Easy to handle, easy to control the amount of water, because that water is not hidden.<br><br>
                    But what our ancestors produced through the ecthing of stones was solid
                    waterglass powder.
                    It's dry, but it's a hydrate. Specifically, a pentahydrate, where every waterglass
                    molecule holds five (5!) water molecules captive.<br><br>
                    Look, how the dry waterglass suddenly turns into a liquid! It's not melting, it's releasing hidden
                    water!

                    Do you know how much water is needed to cast a 20-ton stone with these two hidden water sources
                    (wood ash and waterglass)? Just one drop. A
                    single drop to start the reaction.<br><br>
                    You can start kneading a small stone using one single drop of water, and if you handle it like a
                    snowball,
                    gradually increasing its size, it will release enough water for itself to grow huge without any
                    additional water. <br><br>
                    We tried it, and this method works. <br><br>

                    stones to gradually increase their size, then lift it up and put it into its place in the wall.
                    That's a stupid idea.<br><br>
                    Our ancestors needed to add some initial amount of
                    water to the stone mix and disperse it evenly; otherwise, the chemical process wouldn't
                    start.<br><br>
                    Every drop of water they put in initially became excess water as the reaction began. And probably

                    It would be best to eliminate hidden water sources altogether, right? <br><br>
                    That would solve all our problems at once.
                    We'll get there, but for that, humanity have had to
                    recognize the exact cause of the problem.<br><br>
                    The Incas, and other peoples around the world, clearly did
                    not realize this so couldn't do anything else than leave a small hole on the mold for the excess
                    water to escape.

                    The next strategy might have been to recognize that the dry waterglass was not actually dry.<br><br>
                    To eliminate this problem, it's sufficient to heat the waterglass powder until it transforms into a
                    liquid, just like in the pot above. This way, the liquid waterglass alone is enough to initiate the
                    chemical reaction; there's no need to add extra water to the mix.<br><br>
                    However, this still leaves the
                    problem of the ash, although the amount of excess water significantly decreases.

                    Another advantage of this is that it also gets rid of the ugly gray color, provided the new material
                    is not gray. <br><br>The Egyptians were perhaps best positioned to achieve this step, as they had access to
                    another source of aluminum for the mix: kaolin, a kind of clay, source material of all modern geopolymers.

                    <p>Cast in a mold vs. cast in place</p>
                    The difference here is that while the stones of the Inca walls were cast in place directly into the
                    wall and were never moved again, the Greeks cast these stones into a mold, which is why they are so
                    uniform. (And smaller too, because they had to be lifted afterwards.) <br><br>
                    To prevent them from wobbling
                    on each other, the nubs were turned outward when they built the wall from them at the
                    Acropolis.<br><br>
                    Meanwhile, cast in place, right into the wall gives you that precision "carving" that not even a
                    razor blade
                    can be fit between two stones.<br><br>
                    Oh, and nubs can be on the other side of the wall, of course.
