            <div>Important note:
                since no one has built a life-sized, huge megalithic wall in modern times, any idea
                related to nubs can only be a concept. This is also just a concept, although it is so logical, and based
                on so important facts that it would be hard to imagine it being incorrect. <br><br>

                    <p>What are megalithic nubs?</p>
                    There is a
                    globally observable phenomenon in megalithic architecture, which is the nubs, those protruding
                    things on the huge stone blocks. Like these ones in Ollantaytambo, Peru.
                    <br /><br>
                    
                    When we think about what a heroic task it must have been to senselessly chisel off a full 2-inch
                    thickness from the stones to make these things protrude, we immediately realize that they weren't
                    made this way. Because who would be foolish enough to do that...?

                    <p>For lifting the stones?</p>
                    Another interesting question besides "how were they made" is "what were they made for"?
                    A common
                    belief is that these were created to make it easier to lift the multi-ton stones.<br><br>
                    But if we look at this famous one located in Cusco, focusing on the large stone in the center, we
                    can
                    easily realize that this explanation is ridiculous.<br><br>
                    This nub is too small, there's only one of it, and it's in an impossible corner.

                    What other characteristics should we pay attention to? So far, whichever we looked at, the nubs were
                    at the bottom of the rock.<br><br>
                    Let's look around the globe to see if the nubs are at the bottom in other locations as well.<br><br>
                    At first glance, it seems we are in luck because the nubs on the Pyramid of Menkaure, which is only
                    half a planet away, are also at the bottom.

                    <p>Technical and functional nubs</p>
                    Before we look at a fine example where the nubs are not at the bottom of the stone, let's introduce
                    a new concept related to nubs. Let's call those that are at the bottom of the stones technical
                    nubs.<br><br>
                    Because there are also non-technical nubs, that play a certain role, or even coding a message etc.
                    I'm not ruling out this possibility. Let's call those functional nubs.
                    <br><br>
                    Technical nubs are created as a result of stone-making technology and are essential for the health
                    of the stone. Like these nubs in a Roman amphitheater in Turkey.

                    <p>Nubs not at the bottom</p>
                    Before you accuse us of filtering out various kinds of nubs we like, let's see a good example where
                    the
                    nubs aren't on the bottom, yet we can still explain them.<br><br>
                    These nubs are lined up on one side of the Acropolis in Greece, and not a single one is found on
                    the lower side of the stone. What's going on here?<br><br>
                    The nubs of the Acropolis are technical nubs too, they were on the bottom when the stone was cast.

                    <p>Cast in a mold vs. cast in place</p>
                    The difference here is that while the stones of the Inca walls were cast in place directly into the
                    wall and were never moved again, the Greeks cast these stones into a mold, which is why they are so
                    uniform. (And smaller too, because they had to be lifted afterwards.) <br><br>
                    To prevent them from wobbling
                    on each other, the nubs were turned outward when they built the wall from them at the
                    Acropolis.<br><br>
                    Meanwhile, cast in place, right into the wall gives you that precision "carving" that not even a
                    razor blade
                    can be fit between two stones.<br><br>
                    Oh, and nubs can be on the other side of the wall, of course.

                    There was something that these ancient civilizations couldn't control during stone-making, even
                    though they obviously knew the recipe, as the stones are there. <br><br>
                    But there was something that consistently spoiled their efforts.<br><br>
                    They couldn't control the amount of water in
                    the mix. The reason for this is that no matter how little water they added to the mix, many times
                    that amount was generated later on in the material. </div>

                    Watch this video closely. You can see a hand mixing wood ash with waterglass. <br><br>
                    It's important to note
                    that very little waterglass is added, and the mix starts out almost bone dry. But as he begins to
                    stir and knead, the material becomes increasingly moist, and by the end, it's completely
                    soggy.<br><br>
                    "Something" added a lot of plus water to the mix. Was it God?

                    <p>What is a hydrate?</p>
                    What happened here is that one of the components of the wood ash is a hydrate, containing water
                    molecules embedded.
                    So the ash looks dry, touches dry - it's definitely dry, but...<br><br>
                    But one of its components secretly contains bound water molecules. These water molecules
                    are held captive until the component itself transforms into another molecule. <br><br>
                    At that moment, the previously held water molecules become free again. You can't control it, you
                    can't undo it.
                    And this is only the first hydrate in the mix...

                    <p>Wait! There is more! More hydrate!</p>
                    The amount of water coming from the ash is significant.
                    However, what makes the struggle with
                    excess water completely hopeless is the waterglass. <br><br>
                    The type we use in the 21st century is a liquid, containing a well known amount of water and nothing more. 
                    Easy to handle, easy to control the amount of water, because that water is not hidden.<br><br>
                    But what our ancestors produced through the ecthing of stones was solid
                    waterglass powder.
                    It's dry, but it's a hydrate. Specifically, a pentahydrate, where every waterglass
                    molecule holds five (5!) water molecules captive.<br><br>
                    Look, how the dry waterglass suddenly turns into a liquid! It's not melting, it's releasing hidden water!

                    In fact, these two sources (dry wood ash + dry waterglass) releases so much water you
                    don't need to add any more water to make a stone. Except...<br><br>
                    Except you NEED to add some water to the mix in the beginning to make the mix wet in order to start the chemical reaction which - as a
                    side effect -
                    releases more water.<br><br>
