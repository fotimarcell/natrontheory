                    <p>What are megalithic nubs?</p>
                    There is a globally observable phenomenon in megalithic architecture: the nubs—those protruding
                    elements on huge stone blocks, like the ones in Ollantaytambo, Peru.
                    <br /><br>
                    Considering the monumental task it would have been to senselessly chisel off a full 2-inch thickness
                    from the stones just to make these protrusions, we can immediately deduce they were not crafted in
                    such a manner. After all, who would be foolish enough to undertake such a feat?

                    <p>And what is this?</p>
                    It's important to note that not all protrusions are "nubs" in the sense we use the term.
                    Real nubs lost their functions long time ago. The reason we don't know their purpose is
                    because they no longer serve one.<br><br>
                    But this one, and many others were created with a specific purpose in mind.
                    After all, artificial stone can intentionally be shaped into forms, such as
                    supports designed to hold up a beam or a door or some another function.

                    <p>For lifting the stones?</p>
                    Some say nubs are there to make lifting these gigantic the stones easier.
                    But if we look at this famous, 12 angled stone located in Cusco, it
                    becomes clear that this explanation does not hold water.<br><br>
                    This nub is too small, there's only one of it, and it's in an impractical corner.
                    <br><br>
                    Another theory suggests that our ancestors used the nubs to convey some kind of message to us.
                    For all I care, that could very well be true—but only after we've understood the technological
                    necessity behind the nubs.

                    If you take a closer, more careful look at the real nubs (not door hinges), you'll find them at the
                    bottom of the
                    stones in most cases, with only a few exceptions. This is the case all over the world,
                    nubs at the bottom, from Peru to Greece, Egypt, India, and even Japan.<br><br>

                    Before you think we are selectively presenting certain types of nubs, let's see a good example where
                    the
                    nubs aren't on the bottom, yet we can still explain them later.<br><br>
                    These nubs are lined up on one side of the Acropolis in Greece, with none on
                    the lower side of the stone. What's going on here?<br><br>
                    Let's set these aside for now; we'll return to them later and continue our discussion.

                    Finally, there are the hidden nubs. If one stone in a wall has a nub,
                    the others should have them too, provided they were cast from the same material.
                    However, if we don't see nubs on every stone, it means those nubs might be
                    on the opposite side of the wall. <br><br>
                    Or it could mean that the stone is actually just a plastered layer and not thick at all.

                    <p>The role of water</p>
                    To understand the true role of the nubs, we need to explore a characteristic of modern-day concrete.
                    The concrete we use today is a hydrate (more precisely: relies on hydration reactions). <br><br>
                    This means that up to 40-50% of the water used in mixing remains within the material forever,
                    actively participating in the chemical reactions.
                    <br><br>
                    The remaining water will only evaporate slowly, possibly over the course of years, but this does not
                    pose any issues regarding the strength of the concrete. We build on it confidently without waiting for it 
                    to become dry.

                    <p>Ancient artificial stones</p>
                    …and this is the polar opposite of how some ancient artificial stones set.
                    While water is also needed for mixing in their case, it becomes entirely unnecessary
                    during the curing process—so much so that if it's not removed, it can ruin the stone.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, it gets released during the curing
                    process right back into the mix and quite literally turns the stone into
                    a puddle if it's not removed.<br><br>
                    (Some of the) ancient artificial stones are not hydrates!

                    This mixture feels solid to the touch and remains so as it sets. <br><br>
                    The second mold (upside down silicone pyramid mold) has no hole at the bottom, but the top is open enough to allow

                    So, unlike concrete, ancient artificial stones can't be built upon at all if the excess

                    Whether the stone is cast in a mold or directly into the wall, the simplest solution for removing
                    the excess water is a drainage hole. It doesn't matter what the formwork is made of—it could
                    be wood or fabric—a hole needs to be drilled at the bottom. <br><br>
                    To prevent the entire stone from leaking out through the hole, a piece of fabric is placed over it,
                    allowing only the water to pass through. The fabric bulges out, but behind it, the nub's material
                    is the same as the stone, which is why it literally hardens into solid rock.

                    Yes, these nubs aren't at the bottom. Anymore. But during casting, they were positioned
                    at the bottom. It's quite telling that the stones are nearly identical in size, and
                    the nubs are precisely centered. <br><br>These blocks were likely cast in wooden molds
                    that had a hole at the bottom for water drainage. Naturally, they were poured with the nubs facing
                    downward.
                    Once set, the blocks were rotated and built into walls to ensure they wouldn't wobble.

                    the stones,
                    beyond the mold would also have been carved. Sounds believable, right?<br><br>
                    Not at all. Just as no one would be foolish enough to carve nubs, no one would be foolish enough to

                    separately in a mold that included two drainage holes at each end. <br><br>
                    After that, they rotated the finished lintel to ensure it wouldn't wobble and
                    placed it on top of the columns. The two stones below were not cast in this position either; they
