                    <p>What are megalithic nubs?</p>
                    There is a globally observable phenomenon in megalithic architecture: the nubs—those protruding
                    elements on huge stone blocks, like the ones in Ollantaytambo, Peru.
                    <br /><br>
                    Considering the monumental task it would have been to senselessly chisel off a full 2-inch thickness
                    from the stones just to make these protrusions, we can immediately deduce they were not crafted in
                    such a manner. After all, who would be foolish enough to undertake such a feat?

                    <p>Nubs position</p>
                    If you take a closer, more careful look at them, you'll find them at the bottom of the
                    stones in most cases, with only a few exceptions. This is the case all over the world,
                    nubs at the bottom, from Peru to Greece, Egypt, India, and even Japan.<br><br>
                    Why? <br><br>
                    Some say it's to make lifting these gigantic the stones easier.

                    But if we look at this famous stoone, the 12 angled stone located in Cusco, it
                    becomes clear that this explanation does not hold water.<br><br>
                    This nub is too small, there's only one of it, and it's in an impractical corner.
                    At least, it is at the bottom of the stone. But wait! What if it is not at the bottom?<br><br>
                    Another theory suggests that our ancestors used the nubs to convey some kind of message to us.
                    For all I care, that could very well be true—but only after we've understood the technological
                    necessity behind the nubs.

                    Before you think we are selectively presenting certain types of nubs, let's see a good example where
                    the
                    nubs aren't on the bottom, yet we can still explain them later.<br><br>
                    These nubs are lined up on one side of the Acropolis in Greece, with none on
                    the lower side of the stone. What's going on here?<br><br>
                    Let's set these aside for now; we'll return to them later and continue our discussion.

                    Then there are nubs as big as a human head, like these ones in Yangshan Quarry, China. <br><br>
                    For now, I classify these in a separate category—not because the explanation below couldn't apply
                    to them as well, but because you wouldn't believe it anyway.

                    <p>Hidden nubs</p>
                    Finally, there are the hidden nubs. If one stone in a wall has a nub,
                    the others should have them too, provided they were cast from the same material.
                    However, if we don't see nubs on every stone, it means those nubs might be
                    on the opposite side of the wall. <br><br>
                    Or it could mean that the stone is actually just a plastered layer and not thick at all.

                    <p>The role of water</p>
                    To understand the true role of the nubs, we need to explore a characteristic of modern-day concrete.
                    The concrete we use today is a hydrate (more precisely: relies on hydration reactions). <br><br>
                    This means that much of the water used in mixing remains within the material,
                    actively participating in the curing process and the chemical reactions,
                    forming compounds that become an integral part of the solid structure.
                    <br><br>
                    50% of the used water remains in the concrete, making it stronger.

                    …and this is the polar opposite of how some ancient artificial stones set.
                    While water is also needed for mixing in their case, it becomes entirely unnecessary
                    during the curing process—so much so that if it's not removed, it can ruin the stone.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, it gets released during the curing
                    process right back into the mix and quite literally turns the stone into 
                    a puddle if it's not removed.

                    Now take a look at this video. We poured a mixture of artificial limestone into three different
                    molds.
                    The first mold has a hole (nub) at the bottom, allowing the water released during the curing process
                    to escape.
                    This mixture feels solid to the touch and remains so as it sets. <br><br>
                    The second mold (upside down pyramid) has no hole at the bottom, but the top is open enough to allow
                    for evaporation.
                    Even so, the material begins to soften during curing. <br><br>
                    The third mold was completely sealed, leaving no way for the water to escape. That stone is
                    ruined—it turns into a puddle.

                    <p>Mitigating the excess water problem</p>
                    Whether the stone is cast in a mold or directly into the wall, the simplest solution for removing
                    the excess water is a drainage hole. It doesn't matter what the formwork is made of—it could
                    be wood or fabric—a hole needs to be drilled at the bottom. <br><br>
                    To prevent the entire stone from leaking out through the hole, a piece of fabric is placed over it,
                    allowing only the water to pass through. The fabric bulges out, but behind it, the nub's material
                    is the same as the stone, which is why it literally hardens into solid rock.

                    Yes, these nubs aren't at the bottom. Anymore. But during casting, they were positioned
                    at the bottom. It's quite telling that the stones are nearly identical in size, and
                    the nubs are precisely centered. <br><br>These blocks were likely cast in wooden molds
                    that had a hole at the bottom for water drainage. Naturally, they were poured with the nubs facing
                    downward.
                    Once set, the blocks were rotated and built into walls to ensure they wouldn't wobble.

                    Now take a look at this roman wall. If these nubs were carved, then the overflow of material on the
                    top of
                    the stones,
                    beyond the mold would also have been carved. Sounds believable, right?<br><br>
                    Not at all. Just as no one would be foolish enough to carve nubs, no one would be foolish enough to
                    carve overflow either.

                    the nubs on it. <br><br>
                    What's particularly interesting here is that while the two columns were cast
                    standing up, possibly on site since the nubs are on the bottom of the column, the lintel was cast
                    separately in a
                    mold that included two drainage holes at each end. <br><br>
                    After that, they rotated the finished lintel to ensure it wouldn't wobble and
                    placed it on top of the columns. The two stones below were not cast in this position either; they
                    were cast with the nubs facing downward.
