                    <p>What are megalithic nubs?</p>
                    There is a globally observable phenomenon in megalithic architecture: the nubs—those protruding
                    elements on huge stone blocks, like the ones in Ollantaytambo, Peru.
                    <br /><br>
                    Considering the monumental task it would have been to senselessly chisel off a full 2-inch thickness
                    from the stones just to make these protrusions, we can immediately deduce they were not crafted in
                    such a manner. After all, who would be foolish enough to undertake such a feat?

                    To understand the critical role of nubs, we'll use the example of artificial limestone, 
                    as it's easier to grasp than the case of artificial granite. <br><br>
                    Nubs play an important role 
                    in aiding the solidification of artificial stones. Without them, the hardening process slows

                    rich in calcium and carbonate ions. The water was released into a valley, where it deposited on the
                    surface.
                    It took only half a century for this huge limestone hill to form.<br><br>

                    It really takes hundreds of millions of years for sediment layers several kilometers thick to
                    accumulate,
                    no question about it. It's called the accumulation phase.<br><br>
                    But if somehow miraculously you have all the necessary amounts in place, you need exactly
                    zero minutes to accumulate it - because it's already there.

                    On the seabed, fish skeletons and shells are deposited in a hollow structure,
                    and the sediment is filled with seawater. Now THAT really does need to be squeezed out. <br><br>
                    However, as we saw with limescale or eggshells, no extra pressure is needed for limestone to form
                    if the CaCO3 molecules settle neatly and tightly together. <br><br>

                    So theoretically, if we have a bunch of ready-to-use CaCO3 molecules that we lay
                    down neatly and tightly next to each other, they'll form limestone as hard as
                    rock—just like what you see here in Pamukkale, Turkey.<br><br>
                    It's basically just one giant, annoying limescale deposit.

                    There is a well-known chemical reaction that produces pure limestone (CaCO3) molecules,

                    The end result: limestone particles floating in sodium hydroxide water, gradually

                    this will never become a hard stone.<br><br>
                    Except it will. It will, if we do that one thing that triggers a positive feedback loop, 
                    a kind of chain reaction, 
                    leading to the crystallization of limestone and its transformation into calcite and aragonite crystals' network.

                    The mysterious step that must be taken is to remove water from the material in order
                    for the limestone to crystallize. This can be done either by pressing the water out
                    of it or by filling it with completely dry limestone powder. In both cases, the mass will solidify into stone. <br><br>
                    With a slight problem... of residual water!

                    It doesn't matter how hard we squeeze—there's no way to press 100% of the water out of 
                    a fresh CaCO3 mass. In fact, we can't even get the water content below 50% this way. <br><br>
                    The same applies on the ocean floor. It's not the pressure of the seawater forcing the seawater
                    out of the rock, nor is it the weight of the overlying layers. <br><br>

                    In the 21st century we purchase waterglass by the gallon at the hardware store. It's a liquid.
                    Easy to handle, easy to control the amount of water, because that water is not hidden.<br><br>
                    But what our ancestors produced through the ecthing of stones was solid
                    waterglass powder.
                    It's dry, but it's a hydrate. Specifically, a pentahydrate, where every waterglass
                    molecule holds five (5!) water molecules captive.<br><br>
                    Look, how the dry waterglass suddenly turns into a liquid! It's not melting, it's releasing hidden
                    water!

                    (wood ash and waterglass)? Just one drop. A
                    single drop to start the reaction.<br><br>
                    You can start kneading a small stone with one single drop of water, and if you handle it like a
                    snowball,
                    by gradually increasing its size, it will release enough water on its own to grow huge without any
                    additional water. <br><br>
                    We tried it, and this method works. <br><br>

                    lift them up and place them into their spot in the wall.
                    That's a stupid idea.<br><br>
                    Our ancestors had to add a specific initial amount of
                    water to the stone mix and disperse it evenly; otherwise, the chemical process wouldn't
                    start.<br><br>
                    Every drop of water they initially added became excess water as the reaction began. And probably

                    <p>Strategy No. 1: The Nubs</p>
                    It would be best to eliminate hidden water sources altogether, right? <br><br>
                    That would solve all our problems at once.
                    We'll get there, but for that, humanity has had to
                    recognize the exact cause of the problem.<br><br>
                    The Incas, and other peoples around the world, clearly did
                    not realize this and therefore could do nothing more than leave a small hole on the mold for the
                    excess
                    water to escape.

                    <p>Strategy No. 2: Waterglass solution</p>
                    The next strategy might have been to recognize that the dry waterglass was not actually dry.<br><br>
                    To eliminate this problem, it's sufficient to heat the waterglass powder until it transforms into a
                    liquid, as shown in the pot above. This method ensures that the liquid waterglass alone is enough to
                    initiate the chemical reaction; thus, there is no need to add extra water to the mix.<br><br>
                    However, this still leaves the
                    problem of the ash, though the amount of excess water is significantly reduced.

                    <p>Strategy No. 3: replacing wood ash</p>
                    However, the real solution comes from eliminating the other hidden water source: the wood
                    ash.<br><br>
                    Another advantage of this is that it also gets rid of the ugly gray color, assuming the replacement
                    material
                    is not gray. <br><br>The Egyptians were perhaps best positioned to achieve this step, as they had
                    access to
                    another source of aluminum for the mix: kaolin, a kind of clay that is the source material for all
                    modern geopolymers.

                    <p>Different stone families</p>
                    First, let's consider the fact that the Acropolis is made of limestone, which belongs to a
                    completely different rock family than quartz-based granite, basalt, etc.<br><br>
                    Limestone is composed of the remnants of minuscule dead marine animals from billions of years ago,
                    and is unrelated to waterglass or wood ash. <br><br>
                    However, if we also find nubs here, could this suggest that limestone can also be
                    produced artificially?

                    <p>Artificial limestone</p>
                    Yes, limestone can indeed be produced artificially, and this was demonstrated by none other than
                    Joseph Davidovits, often referred to as the father of geopolymers. <br><br>
                    In 2002, he created several
                    20-ton limestone blocks as evidence that the pyramids could also have been made from cast
                    stones.<br><br>
                    He used - surprise! - natron and a soft limestone to cast those blocks.

                    <p>Another hydrate!</p>
                    Davidovits used natron the way Imhotep did, by dissolving it in water. However, had he attempted to
                    use it dry, adding water to the stone mixture afterwards, he would have been quite
                    surprised.<br><br>
                    The bone-dry natron, which can also be found in Wadi el Natron, is not merely a hydrate, but a
                    decahydrate! Deca = 10. <br><br>
                    It releases ten molecules of water during a chemical reaction. That's a heck of a lot
                    of water! Could this have caused the great flood? 🤭

                    <p>Nubs in the middle?</p>
                    If an architect of a certain era, specifically an ancient Greek now, wanted to create stones using
                    "dry" natron technology, then they definitely needed the nubs. Without draining the excess water,
                    their stones would never have set. However, these nubs are not at the bottom!<br><br>
                    Not only that, but the size of the blocks appear identical!<br><br>
                    What's going on here?

                    <p>Cast in a mold vs. cast in place</p>
                    While the stones of the Inca walls were cast in place directly into the
                    wall and were never moved again, the Greeks cast these stones into a mold, which explains their
                    uniformity. (They were also smaller because they needed to be lifted afterwards.) <br><br>
                    The nubs were turned outward when the stones were assembled into the wall at the Acropolis, to
                    prevent the stones from wobbling against each other.<br><br>
                    Indeed, the two techniques could also be combined. Let's take a look at a compelling example!

                    It would be hard to imagine a more beautiful ending. Take a look at this limestone gate and notice
                    the nubs on it. <br><br>
                    What's particularly interesting here is that while the two columns were cast
                    standing up, possibly on site since the nubs are on the bottom of the column, the lintel was cast
                    separately in a
                    mold that included two drainage holes at each end. <br><br>
                    After that, they rotated the finished lintel to ensure it wouldn't wobble and
                    placed it on top of the columns. The two stones below were not cast in this position either; they
                    were cast with the nubs facing downward.

                    impossible that it's entirely mistaken. <br><br>
