                    This substance is again a white powder, with the chemical formula Na2SiO3, and it's produced when
                    natron (Na2CO3) breaks down the quartz (SiO2) in the given material. <br><br>It extracts the silicon
                    from the stone
                    and assimilates it. It eats quartz for breakfast, while it belches out CO2.<br><br>
                    Na2CO3 + SiO2 = Na2SiO3 + CO2

                    <p>What are the properties of waterglass?</p>
                    Dry waterglass dissolves excellently in water, where it breaks down into sodium ions and silicate
                    ions. In this form, it serves as an excellent paper adhesive. <br><br>But if it encounters metal
                    oxides, it shows its real strength:
                    it stimulates them to form crystals. If you drop different materials into waterglass solution,
                    you'll get this colorful underwater(glass) forest. It petrifies them. <br><br>

                    If we look more closely at what else waterglass is good for, we quickly realize its real potential.
                    <br><br>We have only known since the 1970s that waterglass can be used to
                    create a
                    substance similar to, but harder than concrete, and that doesn't require cement. Moreover, this
                    material can be successfully used in 3D printers, allowing us to "print" houses with it. <br><br>The
                    collective name for these materials is geopolymer.

                    If we look at ancient stone structures, we can find a million examples where our ancestors somehow
                    softened the stones and worked with them like children playing with clay. <br><br>They bent the
                    stones,
                    pressed their hands into them, carved them with knives, or even molded a clumsy little monkey onto
                    them. <br><br>In the bottom right corner, it's evident that someone carved out the
                    puma. But the little monkeys look like they are from a different material.

                    And what a surprise! This is exactly how you can work with waterglass-based artificial stones, the
                    geopolymers. After mixing, they are just like play-doh. An hour later, they start to harden but can
                    still be cut with a knife. After a day, they become as hard as rock. <br><br>But why is it black?
                    Waterglass is white, right?

                    <p>How to make a stone?</p>
                    Let's be lazy and try to add the material that's already piling up as waste, since we've melted the
                    stone
                    with fire: wood ash*.
                    <br><br>Let's add some water. You get the play-doh above.
                    And after 24 hours you'll have an artificial stone. Or your own Excalibur. BINGO!<br><br>
                    <div style="font-size: small; text-align: left;">*Wood ash adds the necessary aluminum oxide to the
                        mixture. However, not all ash
                        contains aluminum oxide; for instance, hardwoods do not. The best wood ash comes from Stone
                        Pine. Nomen est omen. <br>
                        Also, not every source of aluminum is black. For example, metakaolin, used in
                        modern geopolymers, is snow-white. Therefore, not every artificial stone is black. Let's call
                        this
                        ash-based stone Stone 3.0. We'll see why later.</div>

                    Returning to the original mural, we can see a white pile of something accumulating in the
                    background. That something is contaminated with black specks. <br><br>
                    Of course, it's contaminated because
                    it's mixed with the remaining charcoal. Then this white substance is carried around in bags, poured
                    out, and someone molds a wall out of it. <br><br>All this is depicted in a singe mural (of smelting
                    metal)!

            <div>Every ancient civilization with access to natron knew how to make waterglass. We see evidence of this
                everywhere (scoopmarks). And undoubtedly, they had access to wood ash. The question is whether they
                tried to mix the
                two. If they did, they could have created artificial stone.
